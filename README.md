# ClassChat

### Why should someone use ClassChat over a normal seminar?
- While it is important to continue having traditional seminars where no electronics are allowed during classroom discussions, using ClassChat can help build confidence in students who aren’t comfortable answering right away. ClassChat allows students to attempt their best answer, giving the teacher insight into their thought process. The teacher can then choose whether to have the student elaborate or not. For example, a shy student may hesitate to answer out loud for fear of being wrong. Instead of immediately speaking up, they can submit their response through ClassChat. The teacher can review it and decide whether to encourage the student to share. This allows students to participate in discussions, even if they’re not yet confident. Over time, as students see their thoughts are often on the right track, they’ll gain the confidence to speak up during seminars where ClassChat isn’t being used (or when they enter the workforce and want to express their ideas). 
- ClassChat also generates a summary of the seminar, showing the teacher an overview of class participation, questions asked, answers given, and student contributions in a concise format. The teachers can then use this information to more accurately update participation points and see where students may need more assistance in understanding in the material. Students can also download these summaries to review what was discussed and see the correct answers (not including each students’ contributions that day).
